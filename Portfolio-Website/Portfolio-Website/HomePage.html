                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>By day I am currently a Software Quality Assurance Analyst in Santa Monica, CA but by night I am a software developer with a project always on my mind and horizon. I am passionate about learning new technologies  
                and I really look forward to the time of night where I get my hands in front of a keyboard and just code away. </p>
                <p>I am thankful for my hard working parents who never expected anything less of me and always pushed me to high standards while never forgetting where I came from and to never forget to help others along the way as
                they themselves were helped by others.</p>
                <p>
                I am a first generation Mexican American with my whole life ahead of me and a deep passion to make a difference. I never forget how hard my parents fought and struggled 
                along the way to be able to provide my siblings and I a good upbringing and it is a driving factor behind my constant need to better myself and to never become complacent. 
                </p>
                <p>I enjoy data analysis and in seeing pure data, become information and that information then translate to an action or innovation. The truth is, a lot of aspects within Software Development excite me.</p>
